  <h1>Phishing Attacks: Techniques and Prevention</h1>
  
  <h2>What is Phishing?</h2>
  <p>Phishing is a type of cyber attack where attackers masquerade as legitimate entities to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information such as passwords, credit card details, or social security numbers.</p>
  
  <h2>Common Phishing Techniques</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Email Phishing:</strong> Attackers send deceptive emails that appear to be from trusted sources, encouraging recipients to click on malicious links or provide personal information.</li>
    <li><strong>Smishing:</strong> Similar to email phishing, but attackers use text messages (SMS) to trick victims into revealing sensitive information or downloading malicious content.</li>
    <li><strong>Pharming:</strong> Hackers manipulate DNS settings or use malicious software to redirect users to fake websites that resemble legitimate ones, tricking victims into providing their information.</li>
    <li><strong>Spear Phishing:</strong> Attackers target specific individuals or organizations with personalized messages, making them more likely to fall for the scam.</li>
    <li><strong>Clone Phishing:</strong> Hackers create almost identical copies of legitimate emails, but with malicious links or attachments.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Tools Used in Phishing Attacks</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Phishing Kits:</strong> Pre-built packages that contain phishing webpages, email templates, and tools to automate attacks.</li>
    <li><strong>Keyloggers:</strong> Software or hardware devices that record keystrokes, enabling attackers to capture sensitive information.</li>
    <li><strong>Botnets:</strong> Networks of infected computers that can be used to send out large volumes of phishing emails or perform other malicious activities.</li>
    <li><strong>Web Proxies:</strong> Tools that hide the attacker's identity and location by redirecting internet traffic through different servers.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Ten Best Practices to Avoid Phishing Attacks</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Be cautious of emails or messages asking for personal information. Verify the sender's identity through alternate means.</li>
    <li>Check the URL of websites before entering sensitive information. Look for secure connections (https://) and padlock icons.</li>
    <li>Keep your devices and software up to date with the latest security patches to protect against known vulnerabilities.</li>
    <li>Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) whenever possible to add an extra layer of security to your accounts.</li>
    <li>Be wary of unsolicited attachments or links, especially from unknown sources.</li>
    <li>Educate yourself about common phishing techniques and stay informed about new threats.</li>
    <li>Use reliable security software and keep it up to date to detect and block phishing attempts.</li>
    <li>Never share sensitive information through unsecured Wi-Fi networks or public computers.</li>
    <li>Regularly monitor your financial accounts and credit reports for any suspicious activities.</li>
    <li>Report phishing attempts to the appropriate organizations, such as your bank or the Anti-Phishing Working Group.</li>
  </ol>
