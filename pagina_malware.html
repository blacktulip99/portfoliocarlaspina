  <h1>Malware: Definition and Types</h1>
  <p>Malware, short for malicious software, refers to any software designed to harm, exploit, or infiltrate a computer system without the user's consent. There are various types of malware, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Virus:</strong> A virus is a type of malware that can replicate itself and spread to other files or systems. It can cause damage by modifying or deleting files and disrupting the normal functioning of a computer.</li>
    <li><strong>Ransomware:</strong> Ransomware is a form of malware that encrypts a victim's files or locks their system, demanding a ransom payment in exchange for restoring access. It is designed to extort money from individuals or organizations.</li>
    <li><strong>Spyware:</strong> Spyware is a type of malware that secretly gathers information about a user's activities and transmits it to third parties without their knowledge. It can capture sensitive data, such as login credentials and personal information.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Techniques for Detection and Removal</h2>
  <p>Detecting and removing malware is crucial for maintaining the security and integrity of computer systems. Here are some common techniques:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Antivirus Software:</strong> Installing and regularly updating antivirus software can help detect and remove known malware threats. Antivirus programs scan files, monitor system activity, and quarantine or remove malicious files.</li>
    <li><strong>Firewalls:</strong> Firewalls act as a barrier between a computer or network and potential threats from the internet. They monitor incoming and outgoing network traffic, blocking suspicious connections and unauthorized access.</li>
    <li><strong>Malware Scanners:</strong> Specialized malware scanners can detect and remove malware that may have evaded traditional antivirus software. These scanners use advanced heuristics and behavioral analysis to identify suspicious patterns and behaviors.</li>
    <li><strong>Regular Updates:</strong> Keeping operating systems, applications, and plugins up to date helps protect against known vulnerabilities that malware may exploit. Software updates often include security patches that address known security weaknesses.</li>
    <li><strong>User Education:</strong> Educating users about safe online practices, such as avoiding suspicious downloads and email attachments, can help prevent malware infections. Awareness of phishing techniques and social engineering tactics is also important.</li>
  </ol>
